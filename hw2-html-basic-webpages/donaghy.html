    <h1>Internesting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <P> Headings definethe outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p> This is how you make an unordered list</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element ( stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li> They don't need to be in anyparticular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

  <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements<h2/>
